## About me
Hi! I'm a web designer who just graduated from university. I realized that design is not my thing for 4 years of higher education. My goal is to go through all phases of the 'JavaScript/Front-end' course to become a front-end developer because it's been a dream of mine since high school. I learned a little bit of C++, Python, and Kotlin during university. It's time to pump up my knowledge and work in IT!
